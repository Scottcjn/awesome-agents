# Contributing to Awesome Agents

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list aims to be a high-quality, curated resource for the AI agent ecosystem.

## Guidelines

### Adding a new item

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.`
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and end with a period.
- Descriptions should not start with "A" or "An" unless absolutely necessary for clarity.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull request and commit message should have a useful title.

### What qualifies

- The project must be related to AI agents (platforms, frameworks, tools, protocols, research).
- The project should be actively maintained or historically significant.
- The project should have documentation or a clear README.
- Commercial products are acceptable if they are widely used in the agent ecosystem.

### What does not qualify

- Personal projects with no users or documentation.
- Duplicates of existing entries.
- Items that are not directly related to AI agents.
- Unmaintained projects with no recent activity (unless historically important).

### Updating your pull request

If the maintainers notice anything that needs to be changed, we will ask you to edit your PR before merging it. If you are not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on updating a pull request.
