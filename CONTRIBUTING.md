# Contributing to Awesome Agents

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list aims to be a high-quality, curated resource for the AI agent ecosystem.

## Guidelines

### Adding a New Item

- Search existing entries before submitting to avoid duplicates.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.`
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and end with a period.
- Descriptions should not begin with "A" or "An".
- New categories or improvements to existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull request title should be in the format `Add Name of Project`.

### What Qualifies

- The project must be related to AI agents — platforms, frameworks, tools, protocols, or research.
- The project should be actively maintained or historically significant.
- The project should have documentation or a clear README.
- Commercial products are acceptable if they are widely used in the agent ecosystem.
- Open-source projects are preferred but not required.

### What Does Not Qualify

- Personal projects with no users or documentation.
- Duplicates of existing entries.
- Items not directly related to AI agents.
- Unmaintained projects with no recent activity (unless historically important).
- Projects that exist solely to promote a token or financial instrument.

### Quality Standards

- Links must point to the project's primary resource (GitHub repo, official website, or paper).
- Descriptions must accurately represent what the project does.
- Projects should have a meaningful user base or demonstrate clear utility.

### Updating Your Pull Request

If the maintainers notice anything that needs to be changed, we will ask you to edit your PR before merging it. If you are not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on updating a pull request.
